Instead of mixing percentage and pixel units directly within `calc()`, consider using a more consistent approach. One solution is to first calculate the pixel value based on the parent container's width and then use this calculated pixel value in the `calc()` function. For example, if you need a width of 50% minus 10 pixels, you can calculate the 50% value using JavaScript and then subtract 10 pixels.  Alternatively, you can use only percentages or only pixels to avoid the problem entirely, depending on your design requirements.
